**Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning on Chest X-ray Images**

Developed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in medical image analysis, specifically for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. The use of attention mechanisms (CBAM) aims to improve the model's ability to focus on relevant areas of the X-ray images, potentially leading to better diagnostic accuracy. The code provides a complete pipeline from data loading to model evaluation, making it a comprehensive example of applying deep learning to a real-world medical imaging problem.

*Key Features:*
*Utilizes a deep CNN for feature extraction from chest X-ray images. Multiple convolutional layers allow the model to learn hierarchical features.
-Implemented both channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Helps the model focus on the most relevant features in the image.
+Implemented a reduce-on-plateau strategy to adjust the learning rate during training.

*Benefits:*
*Can assist medical professionals by providing a quick initial screening of chest X-rays.
*The model could be fine-tuned for detecting other lung conditions with minimal modifications.
*Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations provide insights into model behavior and areas for improvement.
*With further development and validation, such a system could be integrated into clinical workflows to assist radiologists.
